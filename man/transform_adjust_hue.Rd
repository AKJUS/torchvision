\title{Adjust hue of an image.}
\usage{
transform_adjust_hue(img, hue_factor)
}
\arguments{
\item{img}{(Magick Image): PIL Image to be adjusted.}

\item{hue_factor}{(float):  How much to shift the hue channel. Should be in
\verb{[-0.5, 0.5]}. 0.5 and -0.5 give complete reversal of hue channel in
HSV space in positive and negative direction respectively.
0 means no shift. Therefore, both -0.5 and 0.5 will give an image
with complementary colors while 0 gives the original image.}
}
\value{
Magick Image: Hue adjusted image.
}
\description{
The image hue is adjusted by converting the image to HSV and
cyclically shifting the intensities in the hue channel (H).
The image is then converted back to original image mode.
}
\details{
\code{hue_factor} is the amount of shift in H channel and must be in the
interval \verb{[-0.5, 0.5]}.

See \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue}{Hue} for more details.
